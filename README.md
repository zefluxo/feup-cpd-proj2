## Matchmaking Server

First off, run the `compile.sh` script to compile all the necessary Java files and then run:

1. `java MainServer <port>` to start the server at any port, if it is not already in use.

2. `java MainClient <host> <port>` to connect a client to the given host at the given port.

To clean up any files, simply run the `clean_up.sh` script.
